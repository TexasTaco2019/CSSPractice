                <li>Coffee Revs Up Metabolism</li>
                <p class="news">
                    The “dreaded” caffeine in your morning Joe has also been linked to boosting the metabolism, which aids in weight loss. The chlorogenic acid present in coffee is also linked to lowering glucose absorption; ensuring sugar is flushed out of the body.

                <li>Coffee Increases Memory</li>
                <p class="news">
                    Studies show that two cups of the caffeinated stuff can actually strengthen your long- and short-term memory. In a 2005 study presented at the Radiological Society of North America, researchers found that consuming 2 to 3 cups of coffee improved short-term
                    memory as well as lowering the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

                <li>Lowers Diabetes Risk</li>
                <p class="news">
                    If you have a history of type 2 diabetes in your family, drinking coffee can lower your risk by 50-percent according to several medical journals. The reduction is thanks to a type of a polypeptide within coffee that prevents abnormal protein fibers from
                    developing—common to those with the disease.
